# Using DORIS from ICD-API

## For software developers and System Integrators:

It is possible to get access to the DORIS rule engine programmatically from the ICD-API. Currently there is a prerelease of this system available.

For more information, see the [ICD-API documentation](https://icd.who.int/icdapi/docs2/ReleaseNotes-Version2.3/#doris-underlying-cause-of-death-detection)
